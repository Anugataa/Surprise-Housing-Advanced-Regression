# Surprise-Housing-Advanced-Regression
Surprise Housing is a US based company debuting in Austrailian Real Estate Market. They specialize in buying houses in low price and sell them in higher price after renovating them using data analytics. The company needs to analyze and understand the patterns and important factors from the collected dataset of Sold houses in Australian market. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market.
Business Goals
Our goal is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether the company should invest in them or not.

The company wants to know the following things about the prospective properties:

The variables which are significant in predicting the price of a house.

How well those variables describe the price of a house.

We are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
